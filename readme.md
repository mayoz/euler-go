# Project Euler

Euler project gives us some problems for resolve with any languages. Here I resolve them to training for Golang.

Let's continue on [Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) project.

## Overview

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. If you want learn Golang, follow the bellowing resources:

- [Learning Go](https://tour.golang.org/)
- [Language Specification](https://golang.org/ref/spec)

## Running

The solutions were created separately for each. So you can to run it separately.

For example, the solution of the problem no 1 is here:

```shell script
src/0001/main.go 
```

You can run this code on [The Go Playground](https://play.golang.org/).

## Testing

You can run bellowing command for test all cases:

```shell script
make all
```
